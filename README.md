## Introduction

This code is a simple medical diagnosis system that uses machine learning to analyze symptoms and suggest possible medical conditions. It's designed to assist users in identifying potential health issues based on the symptoms they provide.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before using this system, you'll need:

- A Python environment with the necessary libraries installed.
- Training and testing data in CSV format (provided as 'Training.csv' and 'Testing.csv' here).
- An Azure account if you wish to deploy this code as a web service.

## Usage

1. Load Data: Start by providing training and testing data in CSV format. The code uses this data for analysis.

2. Train Models: The code trains a Decision Tree classifier and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to make predictions based on the symptoms.

3. Feature Importance: It calculates feature importances to understand which symptoms contribute the most to predictions.

4. Symptom Analysis: The code offers an interactive session where you can input your symptoms and the number of days you've experienced them. It predicts possible diseases and provides descriptions and precautions.


## Deployment

You can deploy this code on Azure as a web application or service for wider accessibility. Follow the steps mentioned in the "Can we deploy this code on Azure?" section to deploy it successfully.

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute to this project! If you have ideas for improvements or new features, submit a pull request. We welcome your contributions.


This README provides a simple and clear introduction to the code, instructions on how to get started, use the system, deploy it on Azure, contribute to the project, and mentions the licensing.
